### Set up Android

1. Android development environment: Follow the [official docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Select "React Native CLI Quickstart" tab

1. [Create a virtual device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) on which to run the Android app.


## Run Project

### Get Project

```
git clone https://github.com/Maruti-Techlabs/clearvue-native-app.git
cd clearvue-native-app
```

### Install the dependencies

1. Run
  ```

## Run the app

Start the react-native bundler:

```sh
yarn start
```

### Run the iOS app

Ask for your apple developer account to be added on the project and login with your apple id under settings/accounts/apple Id

Open the app in Xcode:

```sh
open  clear_vue.xcworkspace
```

From Xcode, run the app by hitting `Product > Run` (or ‚åòR). This will start the ClearVue app in an iOS simulator, pointed at staging environment.

### Run the Android app

```sh
yarn android
```

This will start the ClearVue app in an Android emulator, pointed at staging environment.

**Note**: If you see the Splash Screen or White Screen force close your application and reopen it.


## Connect a device

1. On your Android device go to Settings > About Phone
2. Find the 'Build number' menu item and tap it 7 times to enable developer mode.
3. Now go to Settings > System > Developer Options, and turn on 'USB Debugging'
4. Connect your device to your computer via USB cable. After a moment the device should show a prompt for you to allow USB debugging for your computer. Press yes.
5. After that run `yarn android` from within the directory. This will build the app, install it on your device, and run it.
